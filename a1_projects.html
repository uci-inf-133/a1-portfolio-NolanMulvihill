            Every quarter I join a group of other UCI students and by the end of the quarter we try to make a videogame from ground up. All of the projects I have worked on can be found on itch:

            Last year I participated in VGDC's game jam where we had a weekend to build a videogame based on a suprise topic. For my project because it was my first time I wanted to try out something.
            In this project I decided to try and implmenet Generative AI as part of a core game mechanic. For my game I decided it would be a game where two players submit responses and the AI chooses the funnier option however it wants to determine that. While Im not completely happy with how it turned out 
            I am happy that I tired and I felt good learning the new skill of AI API calls and incorporatting it as a mechanic. You can play the game <a href = "https://mulvimayhem.itch.io/zotjam-2025-diverting-dichotomy">here</a> (but you do need a chatgpt API key to play)</p>
