    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p> 
       My name is Nolan Mulvihill, I am a second year Software Engineering major currently attemptong to double major in Game Design and Interactive Media at UCI, and this is my website!
       I am from Long Island, New York am my hometown is a 40 minute drive from New York City. I grew up there my entire life, and have always been loved and been surrounded by technology. As a little kid whther it be playing a random dinasuar game on my grandma's ipad,
       playing with my dad's ipad nano connected to a speaker to play music in our little home gym, using mine or my brother's ipods, or my mini samsung tablet, I was always trying to interact with technology. So from a young age I knew this was the route I wanted to take, 
       and it was the route everytne was expecting me to take. Through my whole time in school I have liked most subjects but none really stuck with me or dragged me in. Until in high school when I finally took actual coding classes. Took classes 3 years of coding classes and
       loved each of them and kept wanting to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
       Outside of school in my free time I try to do a lot with friends, whether it be through clubs or just hanging out. That was the biggest reason for why I joined MAES and have stayed in it for 2 years and have even become co-outreach coordinator. While I was at the involement fair (club fair) at UCI
       they were the only club to actually approach me and try to be my friends. They seemed like they actually wanted me at their events, because they did. So my first welcome week I went to all of their events and it was a blast. It took a second but through MAES I found a community and I wanted to be involved in everything. 
       One of those being volunteering, and as soon as I started going I fell in love and knew that I wanted to help continue it. I was one of the few to go to the volunteering that wanted to help grow it so I was able to campaign and many saw that I did truley want to help and so I got voted to be one of the co-outreach coordinators. 
       So now I try to help grow our current volunteer oppuruntues and try to add more for out memmbers. Check out the <a href = "index.html">Main</a> tab to learn more.
