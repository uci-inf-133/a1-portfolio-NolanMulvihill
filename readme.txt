--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

I ignored some warnings and errors. I ignored errors about using the I tag because the system was looking at it as I was using the tag in another way. It was saying for me to instead use em or strong, but I was using the I tag for something else. I used it for the icons as thats what the google materials documentation shows and when i was googling about icons it also used I as best practice. It also gave me potential problems with my image alt tag but I ignored those becasue they were wrong. It told me the discription could ne be accurate but I feel they are and it doesnt have the images so it cant compare for me.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

I dont know I did a bit at a time so I would say around 3-5 (im just estimating maybe it was more) hours but also I did get distracted a bnch so it could have been faster.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
1/14 searched up the badic format of an HTML file and used the google AI response becuase I didnt remeber eveythng I needed to include anc couldnt find the slides which contained examples so I went to the web. I later found out how to find the slides and demo code

To figure out a table I used https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/.

I used Ai as a more efficient google search when I would want the documentation or how to use something I would use AI. When my css code wasnt changing the look of my bootstrap table I asked AI why and thats what lead me to looking at the bootstrap webpage. I also had an error in the log about scam risk with an instagram risk because I pasted an instagram link and I was just curious what it was so i screenshotted and asked gemini. While I was figuring out the sticky menu I also asked gemini questions about the documentation and how to change it the way I want. I also asked AI about what requriemtns are needed for a screen reader to read a table.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I did not consult anyone else on this assignment.

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No
